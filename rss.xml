            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>This Guy Says He Can Make 20-Year-Old Rum in 6 Days</h1><p>The whiskey renaissance has the world clamoring for well-aged hooch, but the so-called brown spirits-whiskey, brandy, rum-have one widely-publicized problem. It takes time, and lots of it, to make them. Or at least to make them taste good.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/e2f264af674f078576011df42ef310ffa99b617d.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Forty-Year-Old Gin? Fifty-Year-Old Whiskey? When Is a Spirit Too Old to Drink?</h1><p>The first time I tasted a superaged spirit-a rare 50-year-old Glenfiddich single malt scotch-I was taken aback. Not by the whiskey itself, but by the rapturous swooning of the whiskey geeks all around me at a tasting hosted by the whiskey brand. "It's chewy," one commented, smacking his lips for emphasis.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/10cf710b8a463d6824e13ce020032719b4374704.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>5 Groundbreaking Techniques That Are Changing Aged Spirits Forever</h1><p>The ongoing quest for rapid-aged spirits is nothing new.
