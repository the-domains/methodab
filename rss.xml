            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Vintage Whiskey: Getting Hold Of The Really, Really Old Stuff - The Whiskey Wash</h1><p>What is vintage whiskey? For the purposes of this discussion, we're referring to true, vintage releases that were distilled and bottled decades and decades ago, as opposed to new ultra-premium releases hitting the shelves today with 40- or 50-year-old age statements. Today's vintage whiskey bottles were simply regular-for-the-time releases that have managed to survive to current times.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/9e30e0d8dd6d969b66d71f7718ad7040683df62c.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Perfect Age For Bourbon Probably Isn't What You Think - The Whiskey Wash</h1><p>"What is the perfect age for bourbon?" is almost an unanswerable question. Or rather, there are so many different answers it may as well be. There are certainly whiskey lovers who believe older bourbon is better, but there are just as many folks out there who enjoy 8-12 year old bourbon just fine.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/a8e5bf4917abe472c6317f894e2dc9d59d815b5a.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>This Guy Says He Can Make 20-Year-Old Rum in 6 Days</h1><p>The whiskey renaissance has the world clamoring for well-aged hooch, but the so-called brown spirits-whiskey, brandy, rum-have one widely-publicized problem. It takes time, and lots of it, to make them. Or at least to make them taste good.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/e2f264af674f078576011df42ef310ffa99b617d.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Forty-Year-Old Gin? Fifty-Year-Old Whiskey? When Is a Spirit Too Old to Drink?</h1><p>The first time I tasted a superaged spirit-a rare 50-year-old Glenfiddich single malt scotch-I was taken aback. Not by the whiskey itself, but by the rapturous swooning of the whiskey geeks all around me at a tasting hosted by the whiskey brand. "It's chewy," one commented, smacking his lips for emphasis.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/10cf710b8a463d6824e13ce020032719b4374704.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>5 Groundbreaking Techniques That Are Changing Aged Spirits Forever</h1><p>The ongoing quest for rapid-aged spirits is nothing new. Spirits that are typically barrel-aged for a decade or more are hardly cost effective for new distillers looking to grow their businesses quickly. In a sea of established brands, that long-held reliance on time as the key factor in flavor inspires many distillers to employ unorthodox aging methods.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/d7a37ed51b743b1d76cf06f92c009062ca8d4346.jpg"></article>]]></description>
