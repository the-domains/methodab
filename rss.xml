            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Ardbeg Space Experiment - Final Frontier Film: The Pier Review</h1><p>THE ANSWER WE'VE ALL BEEN WAITING FOR! While Ardbeg is suspended within its zero-gravity Space Pod, Dr Bill Lumsden has been keeping us all in suspense as he prepares to publish his highly anticipated White Paper on the mysteries of maturation.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Aging Spirits</h1><p>It really feels good to spend some quality time in your home bar after working very hard during the day. A glass of whiskey can help you relax your body and ease your mind as you gaze into the starry sky. It is good to store some whiskey in your home bar and let them age more before opening.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/b479bc1a46f040fab7cad9805307c5e9b5b9022d.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Forty-Year-Old Gin? Fifty-Year-Old Whiskey? When Is a Spirit Too Old to Drink?</h1><p>The first time I tasted a superaged spirit-a rare 50-year-old Glenfiddich single malt scotch-I was taken aback. Not by the whiskey itself, but by the rapturous swooning of the whiskey geeks all around me at a tasting hosted by the whiskey brand. "It's chewy," one commented, smacking his lips for emphasis.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/10cf710b8a463d6824e13ce020032719b4374704.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>5 Groundbreaking Techniques That Are Changing Aged Spirits Forever</h1><p>The ongoing quest for rapid-aged spirits is nothing new. Spirits that are typically barrel-aged for a decade or more are hardly cost effective for new distillers looking to grow their businesses quickly. In a sea of established brands, that long-held reliance on time as the key factor in flavor inspires many distillers to employ unorthodox aging methods.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/d7a37ed51b743b1d76cf06f92c009062ca8d4346.jpg"></article>]]></description>
