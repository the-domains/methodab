description: "The first time I tasted a superaged spirit-a rare 50-year-old Glenfiddich single malt scotch-I was taken aback. Not by the whiskey itself, but by the rapturous swooning of the whiskey geeks all around me at a tasting hosted by the whiskey brand. \"It's chewy,\" one commented, smacking his lips for emphasis."
