description: "What is vintage whiskey? For the purposes of this discussion, we're referring to true, vintage releases that were distilled and bottled decades and decades ago, as opposed to new ultra-premium releases hitting the shelves today with 40- or 50-year-old age statements. Today's vintage whiskey bottles were simply regular-for-the-time releases that have managed to survive to current times."
